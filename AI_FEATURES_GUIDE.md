# AI-Powered Session Plan Generator - Features Guide

## ðŸ¤– Overview

The RTB Document Planner now includes **AI-powered content generation** that automatically creates professional, SMART objectives and facilitation-specific activities based on your input. The system analyzes your topic, RQF level, and chosen facilitation technique to generate comprehensive, pedagogically-sound session plans.

---

## âœ¨ Key Features

### 1. **SMART Objectives Generation**

The system automatically generates **SMART objectives** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) based on:

- **Topic of Session**: What you're teaching
- **Learning Outcomes**: What students should achieve
- **Duration**: Session length (40-120 minutes)
- **RQF Level**: Complexity level (1-5)

#### Example Output:
For a Level 3 session on "Variables and Data Types" (40 minutes):

```
â€¢ By the end of this 40-minute session, trainees will be able to identify the key concepts of Variables and Data Types with at least 80% accuracy.

â€¢ Trainees will successfully demonstrate Variables and Data Types through practical exercises, demonstrating intermediate level competency as per Level 3 standards.

â€¢ Within the session timeframe, trainees will apply real-world scenarios related to Variables and Data Types, showing critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
```

#### Bloom's Taxonomy Integration:
- **Level 1**: identify, list, name, state, describe
- **Level 2**: explain, demonstrate, illustrate, summarize, classify
- **Level 3**: apply, implement, solve, use, construct
- **Level 4**: analyze, compare, evaluate, design, develop
- **Level 5**: create, synthesize, formulate, propose, innovate

3. **Abstract Conceptualization** (10 min): Connect to theory
4. **Active Experimentation** (5-10 min): Apply new understanding
5. **Integration** (10 min): Transfer to real-world

**Resources:** Hands-on materials, reflection journals, theoretical resources

---

#### **F. Jigsaw**
Cooperative learning where students become experts.

**Structure:**
1. **Introduction** (5-10 min): Divide topic into subtopics

### 3. **RQF Level-Appropriate Assessment**

Assessment methods are automatically tailored to the RQF level:

#### **Level 1 (Basic)**
- Formative: Oral questioning, observation
- Summative: Multiple choice tests, basic demonstrations

#### **Level 2 (Foundational)**
- Formative: Think-pair-share, exit tickets
- Summative: Practical assignments, short reports

#### **Level 3 (Intermediate)**
- Formative: Peer assessment, self-assessment
- Summative: Projects, case studies

#### **Level 4 (Advanced)**
- Formative: Reflective journals, group critiques
- Summative: Research assignments, portfolios

#### **Level 5 (Expert)**
- Formative: Peer review, professional discussions
- Summative: Independent projects, professional portfolios

---

### 4. **Comprehensive Resources Lists**

Resources are automatically generated based on:
- **Facilitation technique** chosen
- **Number of trainees** (calculates groups needed)
- **Topic** requirements

#### Example for Group Discussion (25 trainees):
```
â€¢ Whiteboard/Smartboard for Variables and Data Types demonstrations
â€¢ Handouts with Variables and Data Types key concepts and examples
â€¢ Projector and laptop for presentations
â€¢ Textbook/Reference materials on Variables and Data Types
â€¢ 5 discussion prompt cards
â€¢ 5 flip charts for notes
â€¢ 5 role assignment cards
â€¢ 25 reflection worksheets
â€¢ Recording device (optional)
```
