   - Click "Error log" link
   - Look for Python errors

2. **Verify File Upload**:
   - Go to "Files" tab
   - Check `/home/leonardus437/ai_content_generator.py` exists
   - Check file size is > 0 bytes

3. **Check Import**:
   - Open Bash console in PythonAnywhere
   - Run: `python3`
   - Run: `from ai_content_generator import enhance_session_plan_data`
   - Should not show any errors

4. **Reload Web App**:
   - Sometimes needs 2-3 reloads
   - Wait 30 seconds between reloads

### If Subscription Modal Not Showing:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Or clear cache in browser settings

2. **Check Console**:
   - Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
