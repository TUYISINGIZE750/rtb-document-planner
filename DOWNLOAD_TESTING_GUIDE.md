## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Download Starts Then Fails

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console (F12 â†’ Console)
2. Look for JavaScript errors
3. Check Network tab for failed request
4. Check PythonAnywhere error log

**Most Common Causes:**
- Backend not running (reload in PythonAnywhere)
- File permissions issue
- Temp directory full

### Issue: File Downloaded But Won't Open

**Solution:**
1. Check file size (should be >95 KB)
2. Right-click â†’ Open with Word â†’ Repair
3. Check if file is actually a DOCX (open as zip)

**Most Common Causes:**
- Partial download (incomplete)
- Wrong MIME type
- Temp file deleted too early

### Issue: File Opens But Data is Missing

**Solution:**
1. Check if all form fields were filled
2. Verify template files exist
3. Check `rtb_template_filler_exact.py` was uploaded

**Most Common Causes:**
- Form validation passed but data missing
- Template file path wrong
- Database query didn't return data

### Issue: Download Hangs (Spinning)

**Solution:**
1. Wait 5-10 seconds (document generation takes 2-3 sec)
2. Check Network tab (F12) for stuck requests
3. Reload PythonAnywhere web app

**Most Common Causes:**
- Server overloaded
- Document generation took too long
- Network timeout

## Support Contact

If downloads still don't work after all fixes:

1. Check PythonAnywhere error log for specific error message
2. Enable debug mode and check logs
3. Try creating document manually via API
4. Verify all files are uploaded correctly
5. Check Flask version compatibility

**Debug Command** (PythonAnywhere Bash):
