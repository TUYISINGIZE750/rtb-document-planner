# Rwanda Location Cascading Dropdown Fix

## Problem Identified
The location fields (Province, District, Sector, Cell, Village) were using simple text inputs instead of proper cascading dropdowns. This caused:
- No data validation
- Users could enter incorrect location names
- No automatic population from the locations.json file
- Poor user experience

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Location Handler (`location-handler.js`)
A new JavaScript class that:
- Loads Rwanda location data from `locations.json`
- Implements cascading dropdown logic
- Automatically populates child dropdowns based on parent selection
- Handles all 5 levels: Province → District → Sector → Cell → Village

### 2. Updated HTML Files

#### wizard.html (Session Plan Wizard)
**Before:**
```html
<input type="text" name="province" placeholder="e.g., Kigali City">
<input type="text" name="district" placeholder="e.g., Gasabo">
<input type="text" name="sector_location" placeholder="e.g., Remera">
<input type="text" name="cell" placeholder="e.g., Rukiri">
<input type="text" name="village" placeholder="e.g., Nyabisindu">
```

**After:**
```html
<select name="province" id="provinceSelect" required>
    <option value="">Select Province</option>
</select>
<select name="district" id="districtSelect" required>
    <option value="">Select District</option>
</select>
<select name="sector_location" id="sectorSelect" required>
    <option value="">Select Sector</option>
</select>
<select name="cell" id="cellSelect" required>
    <option value="">Select Cell</option>
</select>
<select name="village" id="villageSelect" required>
    <option value="">Select Village</option>
</select>
```

#### scheme-wizard.html (Scheme of Work Wizard)
- Added cascading dropdowns for Province, District, Sector (Location), Cell, and Village
- Kept separate "Sector (Trade)" field for the educational sector (e.g., ICT & MULTIMEDIA)
- Renamed location sector to "Sector (Location)" to avoid confusion

### 3. How It Works

1. **Page Load:**
   - `location-handler.js` loads automatically
   - Fetches data from `locations.json`
   - Populates Province dropdown with all provinces

2. **User Selection Flow:**
   ```
   User selects Province
   ↓
   Districts for that province populate
   ↓
   User selects District
   ↓
   Sectors for that district populate
   ↓
   User selects Sector
   ↓
   Cells for that sector populate
   ↓
   User selects Cell
   ↓
   Villages for that cell populate
   ```

3. **Data Validation:**
   - All dropdowns are required fields
   - Only valid Rwanda locations can be selected
   - Prevents typos and incorrect data entry

## Files Modified

1. **Created:**
   - `frontend/location-handler.js` - New cascading dropdown handler

2. **Updated:**
   - `frontend/wizard.html` - Changed text inputs to dropdowns, added script reference
   - `frontend/scheme-wizard.html` - Changed text inputs to dropdowns, added script reference

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open wizard.html in browser
- [ ] Verify Province dropdown is populated
- [ ] Select a province and verify districts appear
- [ ] Select a district and verify sectors appear
- [ ] Select a sector and verify cells appear
- [ ] Select a cell and verify villages appear
- [ ] Try creating a session plan with selected locations
- [ ] Repeat for scheme-wizard.html

## Benefits

✅ **Data Accuracy:** Only valid Rwanda locations can be selected
✅ **User Experience:** Easy dropdown selection instead of typing
✅ **Data Consistency:** All location data comes from official locations.json
✅ **Error Prevention:** No more typos or invalid location names
✅ **Professional:** Matches government standards for location data

## Deployment Notes

When deploying to production:
1. Ensure `location-handler.js` is uploaded to frontend folder
2. Ensure `locations.json` is accessible at `../rwanda-locations-json-master/locations.json`
3. Clear browser cache to load new JavaScript file
4. Test all location dropdowns work correctly

## Future Enhancements

- Add loading spinner while locations.json loads
- Add search/filter functionality for large dropdown lists
- Cache locations data in localStorage for faster subsequent loads
- Add "Other" option for locations not in the database
