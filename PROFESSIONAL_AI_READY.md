   • Divide class into groups of 5-6 (6 groups)
   • Assign roles: Facilitator, Timekeeper, Note-taker, Reporter
   • Distribute discussion prompts/questions

2. SMALL GROUP DISCUSSIONS (30 minutes)
   • Groups discuss assigned aspects of Database Normalization
   • Each member contributes perspectives and experiences
   • Note-taker records key points and insights
   • Facilitator ensures everyone participates
   • Trainer moves between groups, listening and prompting

3. INTER-GROUP EXCHANGE (15 minutes)
   • Groups rotate members to share ideas (Jigsaw style)
   • Cross-pollination of ideas between groups
   • Identify common themes and unique perspectives
   • Build on each other's insights

4. WHOLE CLASS SYNTHESIS (15 minutes)
   • Each group reports key findings (2-3 min per group)
   • Trainer facilitates connections between group insights
   • Highlight diverse viewpoints on Database Normalization
   • Address any misconceptions or gaps

5. REFLECTION & APPLICATION (10 minutes)
   • Individual reflection: What did you learn about Database Normalization?
   • Discuss practical applications
   • Identify areas for further exploration
   • Summarize consensus and action points

RESOURCES NEEDED:
• Flip charts for group notes
• Discussion prompt cards
• Role assignment cards
• Reflection worksheets
```

#### **Assessment Methods:**
