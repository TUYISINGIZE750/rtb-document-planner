# PYTHONANYWHERE UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS

## URGENT: Backend is Offline

The backend at https://leonardus437.pythonanywhere.com is offline because it needs updated files.

## Files to Upload to PythonAnywhere:

### 1. main.py (REPLACE EXISTING)
Upload: `backend/main_fixed.py` → rename to `main.py`

### 2. simple_document_generator.py (REPLACE EXISTING)  
Upload: `backend/simple_document_generator.py`

## Steps:

1. **Login to PythonAnywhere**: https://www.pythonanywhere.com/
2. **Go to Files tab**
3. **Navigate to your project folder**
4. **Upload main_fixed.py** → rename to **main.py** (replace existing)
5. **Upload simple_document_generator.py** (replace existing)
6. **Go to Web tab** → **Reload web app**

## After Upload:

✅ Backend will be online
✅ Login will work with: +250796014803 / teacher123
✅ DOCX files will generate properly
✅ No more "Invalid credentials" error

## Current Status:
- Frontend: ✅ DEPLOYED (GitHub Pages)

**The app won't work until these files are uploaded to PythonAnywhere.**
