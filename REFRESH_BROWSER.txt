✅ FIX APPLIED - Path to locations.json corrected!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔄 REFRESH STEPS:

1. Go to the browser tab with test-locations.html
2. Press Ctrl + Shift + R (hard refresh)
   OR
   Press F5 (normal refresh)

3. You should now see:
   ✅ "All tests passed!" message
   ✅ Province dropdown populated
   ✅ No error messages

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📍 TEST PAGES (refresh all of these):

1. http://localhost:5173/test-locations.html
2. http://localhost:5173/wizard.html
3. http://localhost:5173/scheme-wizard.html

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED:

The location-handler.js file was trying to load locations.json
from the wrong path. Now it correctly loads from:
  ../rwanda-locations-json-master/locations.json

This path works because:
  - frontend/ folder contains location-handler.js
  - rwanda-locations-json-master/ is one level up
  - So ../ goes up one level to find the data

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ AFTER REFRESH, YOU SHOULD SEE:

Test Page (test-locations.html):
  ✅ "All tests passed!" in green
  ✅ "locations.json loaded successfully"
  ✅ "Found X provinces" message
  ✅ Province dropdown has options

Wizard Pages (wizard.html & scheme-wizard.html):
  ✅ Province dropdown populated
  ✅ Selecting province shows districts
  ✅ Cascading works perfectly

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚨 IF STILL NOT WORKING:

1. Open Browser Console (F12)
2. Look for error messages
3. Check the Console tab
4. Look for "Error loading locations" message
5. Share the error message for further help

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 NEXT STEPS AFTER TESTING:

Once local testing works:
1. Deploy to PythonAnywhere
2. Test on production site
3. Confirm everything works live
