# ✅ Render Deployment Fixed

## Issue
Render deployment failed because SQLite database file was committed to git.

## Fix Applied
1. ✅ Created `.gitignore` to exclude database files
2. ✅ Removed `backend/rtb_planner.db` from git tracking
3. ✅ Committed fix (564e363)
4. ✅ Pushed to GitHub

## Render Will Now:
1. Pull latest code (without database file)
2. Build successfully
3. Run `backend/create_db.py` to initialize database
4. Start the application

## Monitor Deployment
Check: https://dashboard.render.com

Expected: ✅ Deploy successful in 2-3 minutes

## After Successful Deploy

### Test Production:
```
https://your-app.onrender.com/wizard.html
```

### Initialize Database (if needed):
Render should auto-run migrations, but if not:
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Open Shell
3. Run: `cd backend && python create_db.py`

## Files Changed
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Added (excludes .db files)
- ✅ `backend/rtb_planner.db` - Removed from git
- ✅ `backend/create_db.py` - Available for initialization

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Render build completes without errors
- ✅ Application starts successfully
- ✅ Location dropdowns work on production
- ✅ Users can register and login
- ✅ Documents can be created and downloaded

## Current Status
```
✅ Code: Fixed and pushed
✅ Git: Clean (no database files)
⏳ Render: Deploying...
⏳ Production: Will be ready in 2-3 minutes
```

**Wait for Render deployment to complete, then test the live site!** 🚀
