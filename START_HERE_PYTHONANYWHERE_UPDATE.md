## **📚 WHICH FILE TO READ?**

### **Option 1: First Time Updating Something Like This?**

Read in this order:

1. **Start with this file** (you're reading it) ← You are here
2. **`PYTHONANYWHERE_ONE_PAGE_SUMMARY.txt`** (2 min read - quick overview)
3. **`PYTHONANYWHERE_UPDATE_GUIDE_RTB_100_PERCENT.md`** (10 min read - detailed steps)
4. **Use during work**: `PYTHONANYWHERE_QUICK_REFERENCE.txt` (keep by your desk)
5. **Track progress**: `PYTHONANYWHERE_UPDATE_CHECKLIST.md` (fill in as you go)
6. **After done**: `PYTHONANYWHERE_POST_UPDATE_TEST.py` (run to verify)

Just read: **`PYTHONANYWHERE_QUICK_REFERENCE.txt`**

It has the essential steps you need in one page.

## **📋 THE FILES YOU NEED TO UPLOAD**

These two files are already in your `PRODUCTION_READY/backend/` folder:

### **1️⃣ rtb_template_filler_100_percent.py**
- **Size**: ~10-12 KB
- **Purpose**: Generates RTB-compliant documents
- **Location to upload**: Same folder as your `main.py` in PythonAnywhere

### **2️⃣ smart_content_generator.py**
- **Size**: ~6-7 KB
- **Purpose**: Generates intelligent activities and content
- **Location to upload**: Same folder as your `main.py` in PythonAnywhere

---

## **✏️ THE ONE LINE YOU NEED TO CHANGE IN main.py**

Find this section in your `main.py` (around line 14-20):

```python
from rtb_template_filler_exact import (
    fill_session_plan_template,
    fill_scheme_template
)
```

Replace it with exactly this:

```python
from rtb_template_filler_100_percent import fill_session_plan_template_100_percent as fill_session_plan_template
from rtb_template_filler_exact import fill_scheme_template
```

That's the ONLY change needed in the code!

---

## **🔄 THE PROCESS (30 seconds summary)**

1. **Download**: Get the 2 Python files (already in PRODUCTION_READY/backend/)
2. **Backup**: Save your current `main.py`
3. **Upload**: Put 2 Python files in PythonAnywhere
4. **Update**: Change import line in `main.py`
5. **Reload**: Click reload in PythonAnywhere Web tab
6. **Test**: Create and download a session plan
7. **Done**: Everything works!
