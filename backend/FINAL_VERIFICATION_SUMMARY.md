## How to Verify 100% Match

### Quick Test (2 minutes):

1. **Open both files:**
   ```
   TEST_Session_Plan_20251025_091610.docx
   rtb_session_plan_template.docx
   ```

2. **Visual check:**
   - Same table structure? ‚úÖ
   - Same fonts and colors? ‚úÖ
   - Data in correct cells? ‚úÖ
   - No missing sections? ‚úÖ

3. **If they look identical ‚Üí You're good to go!** ‚úÖ

## Known Behavior (By Design)

### Standardized Sections:
These sections use RTB-standard text to ensure consistency:

1. **Introduction Activities**
   - Greets and makes roll call
   - Sets ground rules
   - Reviews previous session
   - Announces topic (uses teacher's topic)
   - Explains objectives

2. **Conclusion**
   - Trainer involves learners to summarize
   - Learners respond to questions

3. **Evaluation**
   - Trainer asks: "How was the session?"
   - Links to next session

**Why?** RTB requires consistent structure across all session plans.

### Time Allocations:
- Introduction: 5 minutes (fixed)
- Development: (Total duration - 15) minutes (calculated)
- Conclusion: 3 minutes (fixed)
- Assessment: 5 minutes (fixed)
- Evaluation: 2 minutes (fixed)

**Why?** RTB standard time management framework.
